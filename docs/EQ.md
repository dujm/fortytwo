# EQ

When we talk about EQ, what are we talking about? The ability to resolve a conflict, the ability to empathize, or the ability to work in a team? Maybe all them. 

Maybe to a certain extent, EQ is the ability to jump out of the moment, take a look at a conflict from the future or the past, instead from a fixed time point. 

Any conflict, when it happens, a person's feelings can be exaggerated. As time passes, feelings are sedimented and turned into understanding. Generally speaking, if the consequences would be small, there is no need to argue. 

If the consequences could be dramatic, then I might need to reflect, whether there was a cause in the past. If there was, then it would make sense, there would be no point to make a fuss. Just learn from it.

Following this logic, EQ could be seen as a part of Time Quotient.

# 情商

当我们在谈论情商的时候，我们谈论的是什么？是同理心，是反应能力，还是团队合作的能力？也许都是。

也许从某种程度上讲，情商是能跳脱现在，从未来或过去的时间点来看待问题，不拘泥于一时的能力。

任何事情，发生的当下，感受是会被放大的。随着时间的流逝，感受都被沉淀下去了，积累成认知。一般来说，结果不会有太大的影响的话，那没有什么事情是太需要较真的。

如果是结果会有很大的影响，那我可能要反思，今日之事是否有我昨日之因，如果有因，那就是顺利成章的，我又有什么需要计较的呢？从中学习到就好。

这样说来，情商可以被看成时间商的一部分。
