# Absurdity 

In the past, when I felt that "The world is absurd", it was more of a judgement to express my incomprehension of things. 

One day, when I turned around and saw the life plan that I wrote on my wall, I realized how absurd my thoughts were. So, it seems that, absurd or not, it is not a question that can be answered quickly. The answer could change with time, distance, and context. 

Absurdity may always exist. It may be one of the primary colors of the world. But, what to do with it, is a question that deserves more thought.

You could fight against absurdity, or you could wear it. You could use it as an excuse – "The world is absurd. There is no point in doing anything at all". Or you could use it as a fuel – "The world is absurd anyway. It can not get more absurd if I pursue the work that I like".

# 荒诞

以前，当我觉得“世界有的时候很荒诞”的时候，我更多得是在评判，在表达对荒诞的不理解。

有一天，当我转过头看到我在墙上写下的所谓的人生规划时，才感觉到自己当时的想法有多么地荒诞。由此可见，荒不荒诞，并非一时之间就能断定的。它是会随着时间、距离、和情景而变化的。

也许，荒诞一直都存在，是这个世界的底色之一。但是，怎么对待它，更值得思索。你可以与荒诞对抗，你也可以披上它。你可以用它来当成借口，”世界是荒诞的，所以我什么都不做“。你也可以用它来当作动力，“世界反正也是荒诞的，那我做自己喜欢做的工作，再荒诞，又能荒诞到哪里去。”
